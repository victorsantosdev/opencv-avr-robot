OpenCV mobile robot v1.0
=========

Atmega328P robot controlled by Android mobile device with embedded OpenCV
AVR receives TCP control messages by a Android mobile (manual control mode).
The robot has an autonomous control mode, which is activated by the mobile phone too. In this mode, the Computer Vision software tracks a colored ball.

This is a final project of an elective class in my graduation course - Degree in Electronic Systems Development - Brazilian Federal Institute of Technology.

Sources
=========
Both sources for Arduino and Android are in Eclipse project format. 

For Arduino: Import both projects into workspace.
Configure the compiler and linker flags pointing to the used librarys of Arduino folder (original Arduino IDE)

For Android: Just import both projects into workspace, should run with no problems.
