Arduino robot mutually controlled by Android device.

This is a final project of an optional class in my graduation course - Degree in Electronic Systems Development - Brazilian Federal Institute of Technology.

The goal was to develop something using Android concept, so because I am a robot-lover nerd I choosed to develop one controlled by a Android device.

The next step here is to documentate all the project, this will be done in the next release.
