pga_robot v1.0
=========

Arduino robot mutually controlled by Android device.

This is a final project of an optional class in my graduation course - Degree in Electronic Systems Development - Brazilian Federal Institute of Technology.

The goal was to develop something using Android concept, so because I am a robot-lover nerd I choosed to develop one controlled by a Android device.

The next step here is to documentate all the project, this will be done in the next release.

Sources
=========
Both sources for Arduino and Android are in Eclipse project format. 

For Arduino: Import both projects into workspace. Configure the compiler and linker flags pointing to the used librarys of Arduino folder (original Arduino IDE)

For Android: Just import both projects into workspace, should run with no problems.
